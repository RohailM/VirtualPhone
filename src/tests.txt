There is much more to black holes than meets the eye.  In fact, your eyes, even with the aid of the most advanced telescope, will never see a black hole in space. The reason is that the matter within a black hole is so dense and has so great a gravitational pull that it prevents even light from escaping.
Protium reacts too slowly even in the sun so deuterium and tritium are used. Under solar conditions, the H atoms gain enough kinetic enery to overcome the electrostatic repulsion of their positive charges. The electrons which are normally found surrounding H nuclei have already been ionised. You have a plasma of positive nuclei. He is formed in a H-H reaction, releasing energy.
